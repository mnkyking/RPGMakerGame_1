RPG Maker Game with Twitch Community


Research way to add items/artwork to character generator tool.
- this is to better create our own custom characters
- in game character generator
- allows for quick custom in game changes so if a player buys a new hat we should update the character artwork in game to that new hat without having to create countless character templates in the game files.

Research implementing Knight (Classes)

## BackStory and Story Notes:
King Emeric calls the Beastmen monsters and although he is humble and a kind King he still sees the beastmen as monsters and that the only way to have a peaceful country is to kill them and drive them back to where they came. 

He is poorly informed and the other Kings and Nobleman give me more tall tales of these beastmen being cruel, but it is in fact the other way around. 

The beastmen are fighting for their rights to live in peace but Kings and Queens fight them to expand their own kingdoms. 

This beastmen have started an uprising to rebel and to protect their way of life. 

The story after the demo will begin to follow a new young female character who is a beastman who has been mistreated and her home destroyed due to this on going Beast War. 

The beastmen have been tortured, mistreated all due to mankind being scared of them. So around the country humans continue to attack beastmen camps and homes believing that these beastmen are monsters and should be rid of. 


Possibly another Greater Villian manipulating the kings and queens so he may take over the land. A great sorcerer/sorceress who began the hate against beastmen to start a war and weaken the kingdoms.
