# Game Design Document

## RPG Adventure Game (No Game Title)

## Game Style/Theme 
- Need to define art style and game theme
- Theme examples: 
    - futuristic, offworld planet, unknown planet, underworld, hell/heaven, water planet, space, post apocalytic, pre technology, steam punk, Pirates, zombie, nightmarish, dreamscape
    - define the Era of the game
    - define the culture of the game 
    - Dimension/Universe/World Jump 
        - this is a cheap way of introducing different art styles and different themes in a single game
        - 1 world could be water planet then the next can be steam punk
        - this could allow us to provide large chapters for release when we publish game
        - determine what we should start with

### My choice Space Fantasy
- Player lives in city sized ship and that is the player's world
- they quest throughout their world/ship for main and side quests
- then possibly can determine where the ship goes instead just floating in space
- Magical world, strange beasts like dragons
- Fantasy - a genre of imaginative fiction involving magic and adventure, especially in a setting other than the real world.
- What types of weapons are there?
- What it isn't
    - steam punk
    
    
- artwork/references - get a clearer vision of what the expectation

## Art Style
- 2D 
- RPG Maker MV style set should followed and that is defined in the documentation
- https://kinoar.github.io/rmmv-doc-web/
- RPG Maker documentation is local

## Battle System
- Dungeons
    - defeating dungeons advances story 
    - fight 1 or many enemies 
    - max of 8 enemies at any time
- Turn based
    - Side view - this provides a great way to place characters in world environment
- Cinematic large moves?
    - killing blows do larger SFX or Movies
    - maybe only for bosses
- Initiative battles - provides quick actions by player to ambush
    - player/monsters speed affects initiative
- Monsters can ambush and engage combat
- Do have area of effect (AOE) attacks

Environments
- Traps also engage combat or traps also deal damage to player characters 
    - poisonous areas that deal damage to player characters
    - environment buffs and debuffs

Battles can occur in Towns/Cities/dungeons

### Monsters
Bosses
- do they change fighting style as they are weakened?
    - per boss is different and is based on original fighting style
    - for example Ogre fighting with a club as he hits half health he goes into a rage 25% buff in damage
    - for example Wizard or magical creature that when it hits half health it summons more monsters to aide or throws up a shield to block X number of attacks
- do they summon minions to help fight hero(es)?
- 
NPCs
- shop keep, blacksmith, random citizens, 

## Level System

Leveling
- gain experience from fights
- gain experience in different aspects of the character?
    - level up in different attributes based on decisions made
    - Strength, Dexterity, Charisma, Wisdom, Intelligence, other DnD attributes
    - leveling each attribute is done in different ways
    - Battles increase Strength/Dexterity or Intelligence if you're a wizard - basically your fighting ability
    - Decisions effect your Charisma level
    - Solving puzzles effects wisdom/Intelligence

Skills
- list skills based on your class
- as character levels up points are given to be allocated to different skills

## Characters/NPCs

Main Character Generator
- there is no feature like this in RPG Maker, and would need to be created
- no custom generator  this can be done at later time if we really want it as it is a lot of work

Main Character Selector
- fair amount of character art to choose from
- just preset artwork that player can pick from start of game

Pick Class first - other developers can start defining classes and races in Discord
Class - job of the character, defines it fighting style
- Knight, Wizard, Cleric
- determines presets of characters to choose from 

Pick a Race
- Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Skeleton(undead), Werewolf
- more artwork would have to be created
- so what they look like foundation look 

Subclasses - gives additional skills to main class and are general skills
- small skills that boost character stats
- such as %5 boost on first attacks in battles
- miscalleous skills
- alchemist - creates special items 
- apothecary - potion making
- general skills like extra healing gives %5 boost to healing spells

Multiclassing - being able to take on multiple classes but does not pertain to subclasses
- get a 2nd class to attribute level points to new skills from a different class
- can be opened past level 5

## Buildings
### Other
- houses, tavern, town halls, courtyard, festivals

### Shops
- Weapons, General, Armor

## Story
### Main/Side Quests
- allowing players to make their own quests and stories

### Narrative
- story decisions change the perception of the main character and effect the game features
- chapter based
